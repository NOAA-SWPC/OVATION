## Prerequisites

1. This project contains a .devcontainer directory for VS Code -- opening the main project folder in VS Code will give the option to develop in a container

## Environment variables

1. Environment variables are held in the ovation.env file, but the defaults should work too

## Manually Running the model and plot generation

1. The model can be manually run from the source directory with ovation_model.py
1. The plots can be manually generated by running ovation_plot.py in the source_plots directory

## Output

1. Files are located in the output directory, which is available externally to the Docker container as a volume

## Docker

1. See the project Dockerfile (not the VS Code Dockerfile) and docker-compose.yml files for details on dependencies and how things are run (every 5 minutes)
